Goals

	This lecture will:

		introduce the idea of 

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Dynamic modeling connects scales

BC

	Start with rules about how things change in short time steps

		Usually based on \emph{individuals}

WFIG 0.45 Lecture_images/trans.jpg

NC

	Calculate results over longer time periods

		Usually about \emph{populations}

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Example: Dandelions

BC

	Start with one dandelion; it produces 100 seeds, of which only
	2% survive to reproduce.

	Seeds that survive to reproduce will produce 100 seeds after 1 year
	next year.

	How many dandelions after 3 years?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Model worlds

	A dynamic model is based on a model world

	The model world has \emph{enough} assumptions to allow us to calculate
	dynamics

	The model world is \emph{simpler} than the real world

	Essentially, all models are wrong, but some are useful.  -- Box and
	Draper (1987), \emph{Empirical Model Building \ldots}

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Model result

	If each individual is reproducing independently at each time step, the
	population changes \emph{exponentially}

		it is \emph{multiplied} by the same amount in each step.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Scales

	The difference between 1 and 10 is the same as the difference between 10
	and what?

		\emph{additive} difference:

		\emph{multiplicative} difference:

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Scales

BC

WIDEFIG Exponential_figures/ntu.Rout-0.pdf

	Linear scale

	1 to 10 = 10 to 19

NC

WIDEFIG Exponential_figures/ntu.Rout-1.pdf

	Log scale

	1 to 10 = 10 to 100

EC

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Exponential change

	We can have exponential \emph{growth} (population goes up)

	or exponential \emph{decline} (population goes down)

	What if we spray the dandelions, so that each seed only has 0.5% chance
	of survival?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Exponential decline

BC

WIDEFIG Exponential_figures/ntu.Rout-2.pdf

	Linear scale

	1 to 10 = 10 to 19

NC

WIDEFIG Exponential_figures/ntu.Rout-3.pdf

	Log scale

	1 to 10 = 10 to 100

EC

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Time steps

	Dynamic models can use
	
		\emph{discrete time}: we model the population at specific time points
	
		\emph{continuous time}: we model time smoothly

	Which kind of model is the dandelion model?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Randomness

	Do our rules tell us exactly what is going to happen?

	If we have 1 dandelion this year, do we expect exactly two dandelions
	next year?

		Do we expect exactly 1/2 of a dandelion?

	\emph{Deterministic models}: rules describe exactly what will happen

	\emph{Stochastic models}: rules describe a range of things that
	\emph{might} happen

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Bacteria

BC

	Imagine we have some bacteria in a tank

	They are continuously dividing, and continuously dying

NC

EC

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Bacteria

	Model world

		The bacteria:
		
			die at a constant \emph{per capita} rate
		
			divide at a constant \emph{per capita} rate

	Model

		$\ds \frac{dN}{dt} = (b-d)N $

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Model result

BC

WIDEFIG Exponential_figures/growth.Rout-2.pdf 

	Population grows \emph{exponentially}

NC

	As long as $b>d$

Describing a model

	\textbf{Model structure:} what are the rules that our model is following?

		Each individual is dividing and dying independently at a fixed rate

	\textbf{Parameters:} what quantities (with units) determine how the
	rules are working

		Birth rate is 0.04/day

	\textbf{State variables:} what changing quantities are we modeling?

		The number of bacteria

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Simple models of disease spread

	Divide people into categories:

DIAGRAM SIR_model_family/sir.three.pdf

	Susceptible: can be infected

	Infectious: can infect others

	Recovered: cannot be infected

----------------------------------------------------------------------

What determines transition rates?

DIAGRAM SIR_model_family/sir.three.pdf

	People get better independently

	People get infected by infectious people

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Conceptual modeling

Conceptual modeling

DIAGRAM SIR_model_family/sir.three.pdf

	What is the final result?

	When does disease increase, decrease?

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Dynamic implementation

DIAGRAM SIR_model_family/sir.three.pdf

	Requires assumptions about time distributions

	The \emph{conceptually simplest} implementation uses
	\textbf{Ordinary Differential Equations} (ODEs)

		Other options may be more realistic

		Or simpler in practice

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Recovery

DIAGRAM SIR_model_family/sir.three.pdf

	Infectious people recover at \emph{per capita}
	rate $\gamma$

		Total recovery rate is $\gamma I$

		Mean time infectious is $D = 1/\gamma$

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Transmission

DIAGRAM SIR_model_family/sir.three.pdf

	Susceptible people get infected by:

		Going around and contacting people (rate $c$)

		Some of these people are infectious (proportion $I/N$)

		Some of these contacts are effective (proportion $p$)

	Per capita rate of becoming infected is $c p I/N \equiv \beta
	I/N$

	Population-level transmission rate is ${\cal T} = \beta SI/N$

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Another perspective on transmission

DIAGRAM SIR_model_family/sir.three.pdf

	Infectious people infect others by:

		Going around and contacting people (rate $c$)

		Some of these people are susceptible (proportion $S/N$)

		Some of these contacts are effective (proportion $p$)

	Per capita rate of infecting others is $c p S/N \equiv \beta
	S/N$

	Population-level transmission rate is ${\cal T} = \beta SI/N$

----------------------------------------------------------------------

ODE implementation

DIAGRAM SIR_model_family/sir.three.pdf

DIAGRAM SIR_model_family/sirodes.const.pdf

----------------------------------------------------------------------

ODE implementation

BC

WIDEFIG SIR_simulations/burnout.plots.Rout-0.pdf

	Disease starts to decline when number of susceptibles is small

NC

WIDEFIG SIR_simulations/burnout.plots.Rout-1.pdf

	Not everyone will get infected

EC

----------------------------------------------------------------------

ODE assumptions

BC

WFIG 0.8 SIR_model_family/stirrer.jpg

NC

	Lots and lots of people

	Perfectly mixed

Tendency to oscillate

LANDFIG SIR_model_family/comp0.pdf

Modeling individuals as individuals usually requires a \emph{stochastic}
model

----------------------------------------------------------------------

With individuality

LANDFIG SIR_model_family/comp.pdf

Even in the simplest form, this can cause large random oscillations even in large populations

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary

	Dynamics are an essential tool to link scales

	Very simple models can provide useful insights

	More complex models can provide more detail, but also require more
	assumptions, and more choices
